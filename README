== Facepalm ==
facepalm - enduser version of succulent, a facebook stalking tool by yorn.

This Version uses sqlite in memory, so no database is created.

The graph is created by the gephi-toolkit.

To display the graph you can use gephi or anything else that uses gexf.
The tool will generate two gexf files and two html files that use the 
Gexf Explorer. You can view a graph where gender is in focus or a graph
where the different communities are shown.

== Usage ==
java -jar facepalm.jar <FBID> <CONFIG>

You need to specify a config file and a Facebook ID (only numeric).

The Facebook ID of your target is either directly in the URL: 
http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=<numeric>
or, when you run into an alias like:
http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=<string>
you can find the Facebook ID by viewing the path to the profile picture.
The ID will be in the jpg name, in the middle of the three numeric values:
<numeric>_<fbid>_<numeric>_n.jpg

The config file must specify the path to where all the data is dumped to 
and the contents of your facebook cookie like this:

gexfpath=/tmp
cookie=locale=
cookie=c_user=
cookie=datr=
cookie=L=
cookie=act=
cookie=lu=
cookie=s=
cookie=sct=
cookie=xs=
cookie=p=
cookie=presence=

If your cookie lacks some of the above, just leave it out and give it 
a shot. Just make sure the cookie is working and logs you into facebook.
You must be able to see the friends list of the targeted profile with the 
account represented by the cookie.
