facepalm - enduser version of succulent, a facebook stalking tool by yorn.

This Version uses sqlite in memory, so no database is created.

The graph is created by gephi-toolkit.

You need to specify a config file and a Facebook ID (numeric).

The config file must specify the path to where all the data is dumped to 
and the contents of your facebook cookie like this:

gexfpath=/tmp
cookie=locale=
cookie=c_user=
cookie=datr=
cookie=L=
cookie=act=
cookie=lu=
cookie=s=
cookie=sct=
cookie=xs=
cookie=p=
cookie=presence=

If your cookie lacks some of the above, just leave it out and give it 
a shot. Just make sure the cookie is working and logs you into facebook.
