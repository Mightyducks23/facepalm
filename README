facepalm - enduser version of succulent, a facebook stalking tool by yorn.

This Version uses sqlite in memory, so no database is created.

The graph is created by gephi-toolkit.

You need to specify a config file and a Facebook ID (numeric).

The config file must specify the path to where all the data is dumped to 
and the contents of your facebook cookie like this:

gexfpath=/tmp
cookie=xs=
cookie=c_user=
